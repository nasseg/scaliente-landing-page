                "q": "Will Scaliente slow down my Shopify site?",
                "a": "Absolutely not. Scaliente works via the official Shopify API and connects in the background. No script is injected onto your storefront, so zero impact on loading times or Core Web Vitals."

Your profit dashboard populates with data in under 2 minutes. No coding or technical expertise required."

Scaliente does not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties. The app is hosted on Vercel's SOC 2 compliant infrastructure."

For example, if your Shopify store generates €10,000 in revenue but you spent €3,000 on Meta Ads, €2,000 on COGS, €800 on shipping, and €400 on Stripe fees, Shopify shows €10,000 while your real profit is only €3,800. Scaliente deducts all these costs automatically and updates every 5 minutes."

After reaching 2,500 active users through word-of-mouth referrals, Scaliente opened to the public with self-serve plans starting at €0/month (Discovery plan, 20 orders/month included)."
